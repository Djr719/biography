      <h3>About Me</h3>
    <pre>Hello!

My name is Dominic and I decided to take this course because 
I want a career change. I graduated from Rutgers-Camden in 2018
with a B.S. in Management. I realized that I made a mistake in my
major, and I went back to school for medical coding in 2019. I have 
done that for almost three years, and now I'm realizing how 
boring medical insurance is.
        
When I took the Myers-Briggs personality test, my result was
an INFP.</a></pre>
